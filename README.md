# European refugee crisis: interplay of power between politics, media and citizens

# Abstract
In last decades because of the rising poverty and conflicts in developing regions such as Maghreb(Sub-Saharan Africa), Latin America and Middle East the immigration to Europe had been steadily increasing. In recent years, this tendency was accelerated by the starting of the revolutions and civil wars in Arab countries - so called Arab Spring and reached the crisis level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis). 

In our report, we want to explore the emergence of this refugee crisis topic. Usually, politics, media and people's oponion influence each other theoretically. However, The time series data gives us a chance to study the causility of those three. For example, maybe the refugee crisis topic first arses with people's oppnion, then is followed by politics then media. Maybe it's opposite. We will use the dataset with time series (##could you please add the exactly time that we want to explore here???)........
