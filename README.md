# European refugee crisis: interplay of power between politics, media and citizens

# Abstract
In last decades because of the rising poverty and conflicts in developing regions such as Maghreb(Sub-Saharan Africa), Latin America and Middle East the immigration to Europe had been steadily increasing. In recent years, this tendency was accelerated by the starting of the revolutions and civil wars in Arab countries - so called Arab Spring and reached the crisis level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis). In our project we endeavor to analyze the approaches of the European Union, goverments to the problem. We will strength our research with discovering media thanks to  **Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)** dataset that monitors and analyses news articles around the world. Moreover we are planning to learn European citizens' opinion with using sentiment analysis over Twitter dataset. Additionally, we can use UNHCR's database or Wikipedia for more comprehensive study on the statistics about immigration.
